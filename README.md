# spring-boot-swagger-demo

This is a simple spring application developed using Spring boot to demonstrate the integration of **[Spring Mail](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mail.html)** module for sending emails using html templates. This application is integrated with Gmail SMTP server that sends email(s), so in order to send emails using your Gmail account we need to change the Gmail account settings to provide permissions for other apps to be integrated.
